The index.md file in the blog directory is the entry point to your
blog â€“ a paginated view listing all posts in reverse chronological
order. Besides that, the plugin supports automatically creating
archive and category pages that list a subset of posts for a time
interval or category.

To add a post, add a markdown file to posts.
Make sure it has metadata like:

----
date: YYYY-MM-DD
authors:
  - author_id
----

Check that `author_id` appears in ./.authors.yml
The format is described at
squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/blog/#config.authors_file
